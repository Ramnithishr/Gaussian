# Gaussian Elimination

## AIM:
To write a program to find the solution of a matrix using Gaussian Elimination.

## Equipments Required:
1. Hardware – PCs
2. Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Moodle-Code Runner

## Algorithm
```
1. Import the numpy module to use the built-in functions for calculation
2.Prepare the lists from each linear equations and assign in np.array()
3.Using the np.zeros() and seprate them and use it in the for loops so we can find the solutions.
4.End the program
```


## Program:
```

x=np.zeros(n)
for i in range(n):
    for j in range(n+1):
        a[i][j]=float(input())
for i in range(n):
    if a[i][i]==0.0:
        sys.exit('Divide by zero detected!')
    for j in range(i+1, n):
        ratio=a[j][i]/a[i][i]
        for k in range(n+1):
            a[j][k] = a[j][k] - ratio * a[i][k]
x[n-1]=a[n-1][n]/a[n-1][n-1]
for i in range(n-2,-1,-1):
    x[i]=a[i][n]
    for j in range(i+1,n):
        x[i]=x[i]-a[i][j]*x[j]
    x[i]= x[i]/a[i][i]
for i in range(n):
    print('X%d = %0.02f'%(i,x[i]), end=' ')

```
